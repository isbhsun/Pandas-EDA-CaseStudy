    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this exploratory data analysi, we examined the Trending YouTube Video Statistics data. Specifically, we were interested in different measures of engagement on trending YouTube videos. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Description\n",
    "The data describe a set of top-trending videos on the YouTube platform by various countries. The countries included in our analysis are:\n",
    "    - United States\n",
    "    - Great Britain\n",
    "    - Canada\n",
    "    - Germany\n",
    "    - France\n",
    "    - India\n",
    "\n",
    "The main information included in the data were:\n",
    "    - Trending Date\n",
    "    - Video Title\n",
    "    - YouTube Channel\n",
    "    - Time the video was published\n",
    "    - Category\n",
    "    - Tags\n",
    "    - Number of views\n",
    "    - Number of likes\n",
    "    - Number of dislikes\n",
    "    - Number of comments\n",
    "    \n",
    "Since our focus for this project was engagement rates, our three most important variables were likes, dislikes, and comments. To normalize engagement rates, we divided the total number of likes and dislikes by the number of views, and the number of comments by the number of views. The data are based on daily top trending YouTube videos, so a video that is trending for multiple days will appear multiple times in the data. We examined the engagement and views for the most recent date that a video was trending. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Missing/Excluded Data\n",
    "For the purposes of this project we removed any observations where comments and/or likes and dislikes were disabled for the video and any videos that had an error or were removed from our analysis. In total, there were only 23 videos that were removed or had an error in the US dataset and 696 videos with comments or likes disabled in the US dataset. \n",

    "This figure shows the frequency of videos with different engagement rates. From this graph, it appears that there are many videos with no comments. It is more common for a video to have a few likes and/or dislikes than to have no likes or dislikes. This is expected as the effort involved in engaging by commenting on a video is much higher than liking or disliking a video. Generally, there are fewer videos with higher rates of engagement. Interestingly, the frequency of videos with more comments per view increases slightly as the rate of commenting increases from about 6 comments per 100 views to 10 comments per 100 views. "
